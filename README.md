## Common Password Attacks

### Brute Force Attack
A brute force attack tries all possible character combinations until the correct password is found. Longer and complex passwords take more time to crack.

### Dictionary Attack
A dictionary attack uses common words and leaked passwords from databases to guess passwords. Simple and common passwords are easily cracked.


## Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
- Use at least 12–16 characters
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid using personal information
- Do not reuse passwords
- Use unique passwords for each account
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Use a password manager if possible


## Key Learnings
- Password length greatly increases security
- Complex passwords reduce the risk of brute force attacks
- Simple passwords are easily cracked using dictionary attacks
- Strong passwords are essential for account security



## Conclusion
Password complexity plays a major role in cybersecurity. Using strong and unique passwords helps protect accounts from common attacks such as brute force and dictionary attacks.
